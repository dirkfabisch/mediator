mediator
========

A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme
[Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/). I use mediator on my own blog [The Base](http://blog.base68.com).

Configuration
-----

The main settings happen in side of the _config.yml file:

### Site

Main settings for the site

* **title**: name of your site
* **description**: description of your site
* **logo**: small logo for the site (300x * 300x)
* **cover**: large background image on the index page

* **name**: name site owner
* **email**: mail address of the site owner
* **author**: author name
* **author_image**: small image of author (300x * 300px)


### Social

The template allows to add all major social plattforms to your site.
Fill the the form for each plattform. If you leave the share_* entries empty, the sharing buttons below a post are not shown.  If you leave the **url** and **desc** empty the icons are not shown on the index page, but the share icons on the article pages remains untouched (Thanks to [Phil](https://github.com/philsturgeon))

* **icon**:	name of social plattform (must match a name of [font-awsome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon set )
* **url**:	url of your account
* **desc**: slogan of the plattform
* **share_url**: share url
* **share_title**: first part of url for the title
* **share_link**: second part of the share url for the link to the post

The Liquid template engine will magical combine the different parts to a share url.
